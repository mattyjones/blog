# Biography

I am an infrastructure and operational tool developer who believes in the Unix philosophy, writing tests first, and that well written code can be its own documentation. I constantly learn new languages and methods ensuring I always use the best tool or design for a task given currently available information. A codebase, including infrastructure, is never absolute, it’s a living entity that needs to be nurtured and cared for, evaluated at regular intervals and grown and evolved as its maintainers grow and evolve.
