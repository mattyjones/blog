Network, system and application monitoring have come a long way since the late 1990’s when many of us used simple ping monitors or prohibitively expensive solutions that required an entire team to maintain. As our systems have evolved from rows of racks containing bare metal workhorses to large virtualized environments to now containers and microservices, our monitoring tools and practices have had to evolve as well.
