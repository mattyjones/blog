      <description>FreeBSD, the less talked about cousin to Linux is not only a viable alternative to both Windows and Linux but in some ways is far better than either, it really comes down to personal choice and I am slowly choosing FreeBSD for more and more of my needs. Despite this, installing a graphical desktop on FreeBSD still requires a fair amount of work and some measure of skill.Â PC-BSD, FreeBSD with KDE and a graphical installer packaged together alleviates much of the work but for those that don&amp;rsquo;t want or need the baggage that comes with KDE, installing FreeBSD and building what you want is really the best option.</description>
