      <description>No one likes to get flooded with email, most times its just annoying, but it can also mask a real problem. If in those 2000 emails is a single email saying the database was just corrupted, you really don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss it. There are several tools and ways to control email, but unfortunately most MTA&amp;rsquo;s don&amp;rsquo;t have a way to set a threshold over time variable. There is no way to say if N emails go out in N minutes stop sending email.</description>
