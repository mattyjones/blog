      <description>I hate word processors, I end up spending more time trying to figure out how to adjust the margins and get the graphs to look right then I spend writing the paper. I am thrilled that M$ Word will do nearly everything for me, but I have no desire to spend twenty minutes trying to find the right wizard. Content should always be separated from presentation, this is especially true when working on very long documents or any complex documents that contain multiple images, graphs, or mathematical and engineering notation.</description>
